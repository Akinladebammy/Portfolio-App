# My personal Portfolio App

I built a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio includes:

✔ An "About Me" section
✔ A "Skills" section to highlight my expertise
✔ A "Projects" section to showcase my work
✔ A "Contact" form for easy communication

Git Command I used:

- git init - Initializes a new Git repository in your current project folder
- git status - Shows which files have been changed, added, or are untracked
- git add . - Stages all changes (new, modified, or deleted files) to be committed
- git commit -m "" - Commits the staged changes and saves a snapshot of the current project state
- git remote add origin https://github.com/... - Adds a remote named origin pointing to your GitHub repo
- git push -u origin master - Pushes your local master branch to the origin remote
